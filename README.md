# CYB333 Final Project

# Password Strength Analyzer

A Python tool that helps users evaluate how secure their passwords are. This command-line application analyzes passwords based on length, character variety (uppercase, lowercase, digits, symbols), and gives clear suggestions for improvement. Built as a security automation project for CYB333.

# Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a password analyzer Python tool. It will encourage awareness of secure password practices while helping me strengthen my foundational skills in scripting, regular expressions, design.

# Features

- Checks for password length
- Detects uppercase/lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters
- Calculates a password strength score (0–6)
- Provides targeted suggestions to improve weak passwords
- No external libraries required
- Runs directly from the terminal

# Steps to Use This Tool
1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the project directory (if you're not already there):
   ```powershell
   cd "C:\Users\deven\CYB333\Final Project"
